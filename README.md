# CS-370-Q-Learning

For this project, there were two Python files given: TreasureMaze.py and GameExperience.py. The TreasureMaze.py file sets up a maze object for later training use. The GameExperience.py file records the experience of the training algorithm for later use. The last file provided is a Jupyter Notebook which implements the basics for using both TreasureMaze.py and GameExperience.py. The objective of the project is to create the training algorithm needed to have an AI learn to traverse a maze. To do this, you create a loop for epochs and then an inner loop for each individual epoch. During each epoch, the AI traverses the maze through either experience or exploration to gradually gain an understanding of the maze's start to end.

Computer scientists use AI to automate systems and bring efficiency to a maximum for a certain task. From what I learned during this course, reinforced learning can help train AIs to efficiently perform simple tasks through training and data gathering. As a computer scientist, I approach problems by splitting them into smaller more manageable parts, then slowly implement them into a cohesive whole. One of the major ethical issues with AIs is data gathering. To train more complicated AIs, you need a vast amount of data. Gathering data must be done in an ethical manner to comply with both local and international laws.
